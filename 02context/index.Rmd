## terminology

Thirty years ago, I was asked to make a logo for a group of lesbians who wanted to be called "Differently Pleasured" in response to some disabled activist women who called themselves "Differently Abled". Was it a joke? Were they trying to offend the others? I'll never know the point for certain but it raises an issue about speech and who gets to name themselves what.

Americans may have first awakened to their responsibilities for disabled people with the return of disabled veterans from WWII. Pictured here is one such veteran, Harold Russell, who starred in *The Best Years of Our Lives* (1946).

Harold Russell is pictured with Cathy O'Donnell in a still displayed at the IMDB. Russell portrayed a disabled serviceman struggling to reintegrate into American life in the celebrated war movie, *The Best Years of Our Lives* (1946).

This poster was circulated during "Employ the Handicapped" week in 1951. It was created by what is now called the President's Committee on Employment of People with Disabilities, formed by President Truman in 1947. The Smithsonian exhibits this poster, referring to the man's right hand as a "split-hook hand."
